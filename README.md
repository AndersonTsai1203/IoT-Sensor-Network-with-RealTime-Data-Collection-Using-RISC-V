# IoT Sensor Network with Real-Time Data Collection Using RISC-V

Design a sensor network using RISC-V-based boards running FreeRTOS that send real-time data to AWS IoT Core.

## Components

1. RISC-V Development Board (e.g., SiFive HiFive)
2. FreeRTOS
3. AWS IoT Core
4. Sensors (temperature, humidity)

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Set Up FreeRTOS on RISC-V

Use the FreeRTOS port for RISC-V to set up a real-time operating system on the development board.
Create tasks for reading sensor data and transmitting it.

### 2. Configure Sensor Interfaces

Write custom drivers for I2C/SPI communication with the sensors.
Implement interrupt-driven routines for efficient data acquisition.

### 3. Integrate with AWS IoT Core

Use an external Wi-Fi module (e.g., ESP8266) to connect the RISC-V board to the internet.
Implement a communication interface between the RISC-V board and the Wi-Fi module.

### 4. Publish Data to AWS IoT

Write routines to publish sensor data via MQTT to AWS IoT Core.
Implement fail-safe mechanisms for reliable data transmission.

### 5. Test and Optimize

Monitor the sensor network performance and adjust task priorities for optimal real-time processing.
Scale the solution by adding more nodes to the network and testing data aggregation.
